# TH Project 10 

This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the tenth Treehouse FSJS Tech Degree project. 

This project takes the JSON API constructed from the previous coursework and attaches a React frontend
to it. With both the API and the client running, a user is able to maintain an app that allows for the
creation of courses. These courses are maintained by their affiliated user account. Additionally,
new users may create accounts to populate new courses and then update them as needed.
